# Etch-A-Sketch
Made from this [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

This is to practice **DOM manipulation**,**flexbox**, **Javascript** and of course **HTML+CSS**.

It was fun, spent a bit too much time on colors probably and had more ideas for more features, but I'd rather press on and do more projects to learn!

Here's a bad GIF of the site
